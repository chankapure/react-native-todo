React Native is a popular framework used for building mobile applications. With React Native, developers can build mobile apps for both Android and iOS platforms, using a single codebase written in JavaScript.

Your first React Native todo app is likely to be a basic application that allows users to add tasks to a list and mark them as completed. The app will likely have a simple UI with an input field for adding new tasks, a list of tasks, and checkboxes or buttons to mark tasks as completed.

To build this app, you would start by setting up your development environment and creating a new React Native project. You would then create a new component for the todo list, which would render the list of tasks and handle user input for adding new tasks. You would also create a separate component for each individual task item, which would render the task details and allow the user to mark it as completed.

You would use state management to keep track of the list of tasks and their completion status, and you would use event handlers to update the state when the user interacts with the app.

Overall, your first React Native todo app is likely to be a simple but useful app that demonstrates the basics of building a mobile app with React Native.
